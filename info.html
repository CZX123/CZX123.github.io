          <h3>A Unified Image</h3>
          <p>During this explosive period of Singapore's history, our society was fraught with problems of law and order. There was high tension and mounting hatred between the community and the Police Force. Youths were the main targets as riots and unlawful
            activities slowly took a stronghold of our society. Actions needed to be taken immediately to rout potential safety and security threats that were impacting the community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>Police Cadet Corps (PCC) was set up with the aim to break the barrier between the people and the Police Force and to instill a greater sense of discipline in youth and a sense of civic responsibility in them, thereby developing their moral character.
            The first PCC unit started only with 30 cadets and a single teacher officer - Mr. Victor Seah.</p>
          <div class="year">1959</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>This successful initiative inspired the formation of more units in schools around Singapore. 30 teachers were selected from different schools to be trained as PCC officers at the Police Training School (PTS). This year also marked the enactment
            of the Police Cadet Corps Ordinance in Parliament.</p>
          <div class="year">1961</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>As time passed, the movement started to gain recognition as a credible uniform youth organisation. The Corps was invited to participate in the 1963 State Day Parade.</p>
          <div class="year">1963</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>Formation of the first girl units in Raffles Girls' Secondary School and Sang Nila Utama Malay Secondary School took place. As PCC expanded, interesting programmes such as drill competitions, revolver shoots and visits to Police Stations and
            other police establishments were introduced to inject interest, boost quality and broaden experience of cadets. PCC also began to support the Police in the fight against crime and prepare youths for National Service (NS).</p>
          <div class="year">1964</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>The first PCC Annual Parade was held and has since become a tradition from then on.</p>
          <div class="year">1966</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>PCC broke away from the command of Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) and became a fully independent unit. PCC then moved into its own Headquarters at Building No.4 at the PTS. The first independent PCC Commandant then was DSP Niaz Mohd Shah
            who played an important role in the strengthening of the foundation of the Corps and its expansion.</p>
          <div class="year">1967</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>The concept of allowing units to design their formation sign was introduced. It enabled units to develop its own unique identity and instill a greater sense of pride and a sense of belonging among cadets.</p>
          <div class="year">1968</div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-image image2">
          <h3>Marching Forward</h3>
          <p>The beginning of 1969 saw the arm, sea, air and police cadet movements coming under a common structure with Police taking on the title of National Cadet Corps (Police). It was a decade of expansion as the Corps grew at an extraordinary pace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-cell">
          <p>The demand for qualified teachers to train the growing number of cadets increased at an alarming rate and this eventually brought about the establishment of the Cadet Inspectors' (CIs) Unit, serving to develop young cadet leaders as potential
            future leaders of our nation. A CI is the highest rank attainable by an NPCC Cadet.</p>
